# SCOPE-cam-code

-- Connor Kerry --

This repository requires OpenCV3 Installed on your PC to run. I am using a DFK AFUP031 5MP Optical Camera from the Imaging Source, and have adapted their opencv.py python code from the tiscamera repository on GitHub. Note in order to make this code work, you must install all the dependencies for the tiscamera library as well as for opencv.
